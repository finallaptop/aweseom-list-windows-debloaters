# Aweseom List of Scripts to Debloat Windows

## What is a Debloater ?
Debloaters are used for debloating software or removing unwanted features from software. This process is generally used to remove unwanted software from Operating Systems.

## Why We need Them ?
Most Operating Systems are pre-loaded with software to help a laptop user get started. Some of this pre-loaded software might be used to compromise someone's personal information and introduce security breaches.

## How They Work?
Some bloatwares are easy to remove and others are so indebted to the root operating system that they are difficult to remove. On Windows 10 operating system, one can delete a package by using the following command in Power Shell.

`Get-AppxPackage * | Remove-AppxPackage`

For example To Remove Microsoft3DViewer, you can use the following command.

`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Microsoft3DViewer | Remove-AppxPackage`
